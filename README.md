# password-manager with encryption

Will need the following packages:
os,
cryptography,
socket,
datetime,

Please do not actually use this as a password manager as it is an incredibly unsafe way of managing passwords.
for this to work you need to run the firststartup.py file first before any other ones.
you will also need an environment file defining masterpassword
